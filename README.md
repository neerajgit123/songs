# Introduction

The goal of this project is to provide CRUD django restframewrok project that everyone can use, which _just works_ out of the box and has the basic setup you can expand on. 

Project is written with python 3.11.4 in mind.
### virtualenv

This assumes that `python3` is linked to valid installation of python 3 and that `pip` is installed and `pip3`is valid
for installing python 3 packages.

Installing inside virtualenv is recommended, however you can start your project without virtualenv too.


# Getting Started

First clone the repository from Github and switch to the new directory:

    $ git clone git@github.com/USERNAME/{{ project_name }}.git
    $ cd {{ project_name }}
    
Activate the virtualenv for your project.
    
Install project dependencies:

    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
    
    
Then simply apply the migrations:

    $ python manage.py migrate
    

You can now run the development server:

    $ python manage.py runserver
